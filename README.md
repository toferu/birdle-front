# Birdle

## About

https://birdlegame.herokuapp.com

A single-page web application inspired by Wordle. Built with TypeScript and React.js, Birdle gives you eight tries to  guess eight letter bird names.

The first iteration used html forms for input as at the time I did not know about React's event handlers. I learned how to re-format the input to match the original Wordle more closely from this video series by The Net Ninja. I also borrowed the css animations from there as well:

I'm currently developing a workaround for the grid and row components as the method used in the video series does not work in TypeScript.
